The good way is use freeice to get random turn or stun server: https://www.npmjs.com/package/freeice


Here is a list of turn and stun servers. It's collected from the internet, i am not sure it's available yet. 
If all of them don't work now and you are going to use for a testing. Email me, I'll share my private stun and turn server for your testing only.
